This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized.  This commonly happens when you have an async operation (like fetching data) that updates state, but you try to render something that depends on that state before the async operation completes.

```javascript
// Incorrect Code
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('some-api-endpoint')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setData(data));
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{data.name}</h1>  {/* Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name') */}
    </div>
  );
}
```
