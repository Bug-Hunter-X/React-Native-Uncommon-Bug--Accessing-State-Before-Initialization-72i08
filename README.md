# React Native Uncommon Bug: Accessing State Before Initialization

This repository demonstrates a common yet often overlooked bug in React Native applications: attempting to access a state variable before it has been initialized by an asynchronous operation.  This typically occurs when fetching data or performing other asynchronous tasks.

## Problem
The primary issue is attempting to render components that depend on state variables before those variables have been populated.  This results in errors like `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '...'`).

## Solution
The solution involves checking for the existence of data before rendering components that use it.  Conditional rendering or nullish coalescing operators can prevent rendering errors until the asynchronous operation completes.

## How to reproduce the bug
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`.
4. Observe the error in the console.

## How to fix the bug
1. Check the code in `bugSolution.js` to see the corrected implementation using conditional rendering and the optional chaining operator.
